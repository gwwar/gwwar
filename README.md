Hi y'all! I'm an Engineering Manager at GitHub âœ¨. I'm also a huge fan of open source, so you may see me contributing from time to time at WordPress or Discourse.

If for some reason you're struggling with z-indexes, I have a really minimal Chrome extension that can help [debug z-index stacking contexts](https://github.com/gwwar/z-context).
